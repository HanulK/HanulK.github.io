# Maxwell equations
Maxwell equations are fundamental rules in electromagnetics. It is consist of 4 coupled PDE   

![maxwell](https://github.com/HanulK/HanulK.github.io/blob/master/pictures/maxwell1.PNG?raw=true)

## Faraday law

$$ \oint_{C}E\cdot\,dl=-\int_{S}^{}\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}\cdot \,ds $$

$$ \nabla\times E=-\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} $$   

It is based on the experimental fact that time varying magnetic flux makes electromotive force (rotational electric fields).


## Gauss law

$$ \oint_{S}D\cdot\,ds=\int_{V}^{}\tilde{\rho} \,dv $$   

$$ \nabla\cdot D=\tilde{\rho} $$   

Gauss’s law describes the static electric field generated by a distribution of electric charges.
In detail, electric flux through any closed surface equal to total electric charge enclosed by this surface.
In integral formation of Gauss's law, the divergence theorem used.


## Ampere law

$$ \oint_{C}H\cdot\,dl=\int_{S}^{}J\cdot\,ds+\int_{S}^{}\frac{\partial D}{\partial t}\cdot \,ds $$   

$$ \nabla\times H=J+\frac{\partial D}{\partial t} $$   

Third is Ampere’s law. It describe the relation of electric and magnetic flux.
And It show that a circulation of magnetic field is caused by a time rate of charge of electric flux.
It can related with how to make magnetic field (created around moving electric charge).


## Gauss law for magnetism

$$ \oint_{S}B\cdot\,ds=0 $$   

$$ \nabla\cdot B=0 $$   

Final PDE is Gauss’s law for magnetism. It states that no magnetic monopoles exist. The total magnetic flux through a closed surface must be zero.
In detail, there are no magnetic monopole means that when one bar magnet divided by two, then we can get two bar magnets not get only N or S pole.
