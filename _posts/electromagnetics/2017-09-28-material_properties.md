# Field quantities

|   Field  |  Quantity |      Symbol     |     Unit    |
| :------- | :-------- | :-------------- | :---------- |
| Electric | Intensity | $$ \mathbf{E} $$ |     V/s     |  
|          | Density   | $$ \mathbf{D} $$ | $$ C/m^2 $$ |  
| Magnetic | Intensity | $$ \mathbf{H} $$ |     A/m     |  
|          | Density   | $$ \mathbf{B} $$ |      T      |  

# Meterial properties   
There many material properties such as permittivity, permeability and so on.

## Velocity of wave ($$ c $$)  
$$ c $$ indicate a velocity of electromagnetic wave in free space. Especially, $$ c_0 $$ means a velocity of light in free space. And $$ \epsilon_0 $$ and $$ \mu_0 $$ are characteristics of each field. The $$ \epsilon_0 $$, permittivity indicates that how well electric fields flow in free space. And $$ \mu_0 $$, permeability means how well magnetic field flow through the material.
These constants has relation like under.

$$ c_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}} $$

## Permittivity ($$ \epsilon_0 $$)
It is a proportionality constant between D and E in free space. And it indicates that how well electric fields flow in free space.

## Permeability ($$ \mu_0 $$)
It is a proportionality constant between B and H in free space. And it means how well magnetic field flow through the material.

## Conductivity ($$ \sigma $$)
Conductivity is a different quantity above two. It is the property of material with allow the flow of electric current through material. It indicates how easily electric current can flow through the material.
